### About Me

Hi, I am a Canadian Highschool student interested in engineering and CS. 

If you found this page, you probably know me irl, or you stumbled upon this page through one of my projects. I mainly work with Unity Game Development, where I turn absurd game ideas into reality, and Minecraft Mod Development. You can also find all sorts of other projects other than those two on my profile, such as the programs I write for my school club, or those I use for my engineering endevours. Outside of tech, I am also interested in math, extreme outdoor adventures and instructing ski at Mt. Seymour.

### Current Projects
- [Blockout](https://github.com/vincor-qc/blockout) - Will maintain this mod indefinitely as Minecraft constantly updates.
- [Inu](https://github.com/Bulldog-Computer-Club/inu) - A moderation bot for my programming club.
- [Startpage](https://github.com/vincor-qc/new-startpage) - A personal startpage that I use, will occansionally get updates until I decide to decommision it.
- [VSHacks](https://vshacks.tech/) - A hackthon organized by my club and several others in Greater Vancouver

### Past Projects
- [Particle Simulations](https://github.com/vincor-qc/Particle-Simulations) - A natural selection simulator written in Unity.
- [Keyboard PCB](https://github.com/vincor-qc/keyboard-pcb) - The schematics and design for my keyboard PCB.
- [Ikenai](https://github.com/vincor-qc/vhhacks-2021) - A discord bot written for vhHacks 2021.
- [Geroge Game](https://github.com/vincor-qc/george-simulator) - An IOS game I wrote purely out of boredom during the pandemic.
and more...

### Upcoming Projects
- Ourcraft - A minecraft mod that seizes the means of production. Expect to find this sometime late 2022.
Expect a few other Unity games and shenanigans this summer...
